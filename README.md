# Simple-Comment-System
This is a simple comment system using AJAX with PHP and MySQL.
This Simple Comment System can be implemented on your website easily. 
It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP and MySQL.
--------------------
How it works
--------------------
- It is ca comment system that doesn't requir any registration or login.
- The user just have to input a name and make comment and then the name, date, comment, and a picture showing the first letter of the user's name is displayed.
- The Admin will also post his own comment the same way, but in this case the name will be displayed as Admin and the comment background color is different showing it's the real admin.
- If a user types in Admin or admin as his name, the system will reject the comment, so no one can pose as the admin.
- The Admin have to enter a specific name(Admin123) so the system can recognize him as the admin, this you can change in the code.
